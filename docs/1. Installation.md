# Installation

## Meet Sneeuw

Sneeuw is a web framework that is designed to make creating full-stack web applications easy.

## Creating a Sneeuw project

Make sure you have PHP, Composer and Node installed on your local machine. Then create a new Sneeuw project via Composer:

```shell
composer create-project sneeuw/starter example-project
```

Or, you may clone the sneeuw starter template Git repository and install the required dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sneeuwphp/starter example-project && \
    cd example-project && \
    composer install && \
    npm install
```

Once the Sneeuw project has been created, start the local development server using Sneeuw's `dev` command:

```shell
php sneeuw dev
```

Also start the asset-bundling and SSR server:

```shell
npx sneeuw dev
```

With those two processes running, your application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:2002.
