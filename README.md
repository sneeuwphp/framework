## Roadmap

First steps

- [ ] Traditional and file-based router with support for (optional/nested) parameters
- [ ] Retrieving request data (query, form, json)
- [ ] Sending responses (status code, content type, data)
- [ ] Front-end
  - [ ] SSR
  - [ ] Hydration
  - [ ] Fine-grained reactivity
- [ ] Using data from server in client
- [ ] Sending actions from client to server

## PSR

Sneeuw does not adhere to any PSR specifications by design, due to simplicity and performance considerations. Also, not following general PSR specifications allows us to carefully craft ergonomic API's for Sneeuw.
